<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="about reveal" id="about">
  <div class="section-label">Why We Exist</div>
  <h2 class="section-title">Cambridge builds <em>world-class technology.</em> We bridge it to the <em>world's biggest ecosystem.</em></h2>
  <p>Cambridge consistently produces exceptional technical talent and frontier research. But many founders here lack early exposure to the commercial intensity, network density, and execution culture required to scale globally. The gap is not ambition — it's access, context, and speed of learning at the earliest stage.</p>
  <p>Silicon Valley is the opposite: an ecosystem where the best founders, operators, and investors are concentrated in one place, moving at a pace that compresses years of learning into months.</p>
  <p>Bridge Fellows brings Cambridge's most promising AI founders directly into that ecosystem — so they can learn firsthand how high-performing teams validate ideas, ship quickly, raise effectively, and build category-defining companies. This is not about observation. It's about closing the learning curve that costs founders critical time in their earliest, most formative years.</p>
  <p>Where you build after that is your call. But you'll never look at your company the same way again.</p>

          <p><strong style="color: var(--accent);">The Problem:</strong> Cambridge PhD. Wanted to build an AI company in 2010. UK investors laughed – "AI" was a dirty word. Most wouldn't even take the meeting.</p>
          <p><strong style="color: var(--accent);">The Bridge:</strong> No UK funding, so he flew to Silicon Valley. One dinner pitch to a tech billionaire unlocked the first few million. The Valley believed in AI early.</p>
          <p><strong style="color: var(--accent);">The Outcome:</strong> Google acquired DeepMind for $650M in 2014. Demis won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AlphaFold.</p>

          <p><strong style="color: var(--accent);">The Bridge:</strong> Targeted the US market early. Flew to Silicon Valley to pitch enterprise buyers who understood unstructured data search. US revenue drove growth.</p>
          <p><strong style="color: var(--accent);">The Outcome:</strong> Autonomy became the UK's largest pure software company. Hewlett-Packard acquired it for $11.1B in 2011, the biggest UK tech exit of its era.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->

  <div class="section-label">Questions</div>
  <h2 class="section-title">Frequently <em>asked</em></h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">Do I need to have a company already?</div>
    <div class="faq-a"><p>No. You can be working on a side project, a research spin-out, or an idea you're serious about. We care about what you're building and your drive, not whether you've incorporated.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">Is this a relocation program?</div>
    <div class="faq-a"><p>No. We give you a taste of Silicon Valley so you can experience the ecosystem first-hand. Where you build your company after that is entirely your decision. Cambridge, San Francisco, London — your call.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">Can I apply as a team?</div>
    <div class="faq-a"><p>Yes. You can apply solo or with your co-founder(s). Just fill out one application and mention your team.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">How are applications reviewed?</div>
    <div class="faq-a"><p>On a rolling basis. We read every application as it comes in. Early applicants may hear back sooner. We select up to 10 founders per cohort.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">What happens during the week?</div>
    <div class="faq-a"><p>A mix of curated founder and investor sessions, practical workshops on pitching, go-to-market strategy, fundraising, hiring, and scaling, company visits to see how high-performance teams operate, and small-group time with operators who've built and scaled in Silicon Valley. Every day is designed to be intense and high-signal.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">What happens after the program?</div>
    <div class="faq-a"><p>Structured post-program follow-up helps you convert insights into execution — including a post-program action plan with short-term milestones and accountability. You also join the Bridge Fellows alumni network: a growing community of Cambridge founders with ongoing introductions and peer support. The long-term vision is a repeatable Cambridge-to-Silicon-Valley corridor that compounds in value with every cohort.</p></div>
